### Hi there 👋

## I am David.

I am a full-stack Web developer with solid experience in team management.  Main languages are Ruby and JavaScript. I used Next, React, and Ruby on rails as main frameworks. Throughout my career, I've demonstrated a knack for tackling challenges head-on, delivering innovative solutions, making me a versatile asset for your team. When not coding, I try my hand at cooking (with mixed results), enjoy reading, and love spending quality time playing with my childrens. Hiring me means bringing on board a proactive problem solver dedicated to contributing meaningfully to team dynamics and delivering tangible results. For further discussion or exploring opportunities, feel free to contact me via email at: lafontant.david@gmail.com. Open to new opportunities.
